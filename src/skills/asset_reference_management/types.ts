/**
 * Asset manifest types — Phase 3 / Slice E-1 of the agentic-harness plan.
 *
 * The manifest is the canonical "three-layer" mapping for every asset
 * the LLM might reference in a session:
 *
 *   asset_id    — internal stable handle (never shown to the user)
 *   user_label  — human-readable name the user / LLM use in conversation
 *   model_ref   — the literal token a given model expects in its prompt
 *                 (Seedance "@Image1", GPT-Image-2 "Image 1",
 *                  HappyHorse "[Image 1]", context-conditioned
 *                  "context_image_0", etc.)
 *
 * The portable contract lives here so chat (Path A), the hosted API
 * (Path B), the public skill, and the SDK can all consume the same
 * shapes. Per-session storage of the manifest is each consumer's
 * responsibility — chat keeps it in `assetManifestStore`.
