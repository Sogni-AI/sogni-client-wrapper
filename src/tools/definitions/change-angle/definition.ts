      'Generate the photo from a different camera angle or perspective. Uses AI to create a new view of the subject as if photographed from a different position. Use when the user wants to see the subject from another angle, generate a different view, create a portrait from a specific direction, or get a closeup/wide shot. Examples: "show me from the left side", "generate a 3/4 portrait view", "closeup from slightly above". IMPORTANT: When previous results exist, this tool automatically uses the LATEST result image unless you specify a different sourceImageIndex or the user explicitly says "original".',

          description: `EXACT camera angle string. You MUST construct this by concatenating exactly one value from each category below, separated by single spaces. No commas, no extra words.

Format: "[azimuth] [elevation] [distance]"

Azimuth (pick one): "front view", "front-right quarter view", "right side view", "back-right quarter view", "back view", "back-left quarter view", "left side view", "front-left quarter view"
Elevation (pick one): "low-angle shot", "eye-level shot", "elevated shot", "high-angle shot"
Distance (pick one): "close-up", "medium shot", "wide shot"

Examples:
- "front-right quarter view eye-level shot medium shot"
- "left side view eye-level shot close-up"
- "front view low-angle shot wide shot"
- "right side view elevated shot medium shot"

Map user requests: "from the left" → "left side view", "looking up at" → "low-angle shot", "closeup" → "close-up", "3/4 view" → "front-right quarter view" or "front-left quarter view", "portrait" → "front-right quarter view eye-level shot medium shot".
Default elevation to "eye-level shot" and distance to "medium shot" when not specified.`,
